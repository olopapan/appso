id="%F0%9F%8E%AC-previously-in-scaffold-starter">🎬 Previously In Scaffold Starter...</h3><p>Nice to see you again, friend 😁 ! Now we are transacting!!! (ahem... I mean talking). So let's see:</p><ul><li>We connected the user wallet. ✅</li><li>We funded the user wallet. ✅</li></ul><p>Now that we have a wallet connected with funds, we can actually start putting our footprint on the blockchain. Instead of just querying data, we can start modifying the blockchain and add data to it with transactions. This is where the web3 line starts!</p><h3 id="%F0%9F%9A%80-what-are-we-building-today">🚀 What Are We Building Today?</h3><p>Our goal is to send some SOL to another user:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://solana.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/DApp-Scaffold-Starter---3-Transactions---Goal.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="974" height="614"></figure><h3 id="the-war-room">The War Room</h3><p>Welcome to the War Room, where we plan our next feature. Instead of throwing code to your face out of nowhere, I want to pair program this with you this time.</p><p>How do we start? Let's take advantage of the companion we introduced before. Instead of googling it, we will <em>cookglig</em> it. Ok, that's weird. Anyway! Head to <a href="https://solanacookbook.com">https://solanacookbook.com</a> and search for <strong>(or Command+K)</strong> <em>"send SOL"</em>.</p><p><strong>... (Don't look)</strong></p><p>The recipe is here: <a href="https://solanacookbook.com/references/basic-transactions.html#how-to-send-sol">https://solanacookbook.com/references/basic-transactions.html#how-to-send-sol</a>.</p><h3 id="applying-the-cookbook-recipe">Applying The Cookbook Recipe</h3><p>What does the above gif show? It seems we will need a button to trigger this <em>send SOL transaction</em>, and since we are clean devs, we will make a dedicated <code>&lt;SendTransaction /&gt;</code> component. Let's start by adding this component to our home view <code>/views/home/index.tsx</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">...
import { RequestAirdrop } from '../../components/RequestAirdrop';
import { SendTransaction } from '../../components/SendTransaction';
...


export const HomeView: FC = ({ }) =&gt; {
    ...
    return (
        ...
         &lt;div className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;RequestAirdrop /&gt;
          {wallet.publicKey &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;Public Key: {wallet.publicKey.toBase58()}&lt;/p&gt;}
          {wallet &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;SOL Balance: {(balance || 0).toLocaleString()}&lt;/p&gt;}
          &lt;SendTransaction /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};
</code></pre><p>Nothing crazy here.

And be ready to dive deeper into these two concepts when you return.</p><h3 id="lets-digthe-system-program">Let's Dig - The System Program</h3><p>What is that <code>SystemProgram</code>? Solana comes equipped with a number of programs that serve as core building blocks for on-chain interactions. These programs are divided into <a href="https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#bpf-loader">Native Programs</a> and <a href="https://spl.solana.com/">Solana Program Library (SPL) Programs</a>.</p><p>Basically, it means that every Solana node runs some programs <em>(also called smart contracts in other blockchains)</em> out of the box.</p><p><strong>💡 Think: What is the most basic functionality for a blockchain node?</strong></p><blockquote>Hint: Think about what do people do with their wallets</blockquote><p><strong>... (don't look below)</strong></p><p>The answer was in the cookbook! What do people usually do with blockchain? They exchange tokens. The Solana team started to think about this `SystemProgram` whose job is to administer new accounts and transfer SOL between two parties. We will see later what are those "accounts" about.</p><p>So, now we understand why we need that SystemProgram when we want to send SOL.</p><p><strong>The SNP Crew &amp; SPL Crew</strong><br>All Solana Validators Nodes are born with a set of Solana Native Programs. And the <em>System Program</em> is one of these native programs. They each exist with a specific job to perform. So depending on what you are trying to achieve, you would talk to different programs:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://solana.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/DApp-Scaffold-Starter---3-Transactions---A-Node-s-Anatomy-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1686" height="1260" srcset="https://solana.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/DApp-Scaffold-Starter---3-Transactions---A-Node-s-Anatomy-1.png 600w, https://solana.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/DApp-Scaffold-Starter---3-Transactions---A-Node-s-Anatomy-1.png 1000w, https://solana.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/DApp-Scaffold-Starter---3-Transactions---A-Node-s-Anatomy-1.png 1600w, https://solana.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/DApp-Scaffold-Starter---3-Transactions---A-Node-s-Anatomy-1.png 1686w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What is the difference between the native ones and the library ones?</p><ul><li>Native Programs are the essential programs that a Validator Node needs. I listed the <em>System Program</em> in the diagram, but there are other ones: <a href="https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs">https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs</a></li><li>Library Programs are additional helpers programs deployed by the Solana team.</li></ul><p>Ok, we solved one part of the equation: the <em>WHO</em>! Solana needs to know which program you want to talk to when we make a transaction. In the case of sending SOL, we had to talk to the System Program. But what is a transaction anyway?</p><p>Once again, Solana cookbook to the rescue! <a href="https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/transactions.html#transactions">https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/transactions.html#transactions</a></p><blockquote>Clients can invoke programs by submitting a transaction to a cluster.
